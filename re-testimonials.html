       <h1> <br> ABOUT US </h1>

       <br> <p>RE: is a second hand store that sells curated clothing, as well as jewelry, homeware, plants, and art from local sellers. We wish to revitalize your closet by providing a selection of elevated staples that have a unique flair & a special feel to them. 
        <br> <br>  RE: began with our creator, Lindsey Wong, who wanted to revitalize thrifting. Buying second hand clothing was always a passion of hers throughout college, and after graduating, she decided to pursue her dream of founding a second hand store, all the while with an additional passion for sustainability and the environment. Lindsey hopes to raise awareness and educate others on the dangers of fast fashion, and to encourage shopping smart. We are now celebrating five years of establishment! Lindsey's goal for our store is to make it a home for all - a place for anyone and everyone to browse, shop, or simply hang out. From spicing up your wardrobe to creating a safe space, we want RE: to feel like you belong.
